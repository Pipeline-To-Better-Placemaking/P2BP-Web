                  <h3><u> Creating the Test </u></h3>
                      <p> Step 1: Go to the create/signup for a test page that can be accessed by going to the
                          collaboration page, then selecting Team -> Project <br /><br />
                          Step 2: Press ‘Create Research Activity’ <br /><br />
                          Step 3: Enter the information required for the test. You can select which test you want to create
                          using the dropdown menu. Depending on which test you have selected, the name of the test will
                          automatically default to that test’s name. We recommend inputting your own name as leaving the
                          default name can be confusing when you have multiple tests of the same name. Then you will
                          select the date in which you want the test to be completed. <br /><br />
                          Step 4: For the Acoustical Profile Test, you will have to set the time that you would like the
                          researcher to spend at each standing point. The default is 30 seconds but it may be better to
                          choose a shorter interval as the test can be quite lengthy. Once you have filled out all the above
                          information, press next. <br /><br />
                          Step 5: Once you press next, it will take you to the time slot page in which you will create a time
                          slot for the test to be completed. Press ‘Create Time Slot’. <br /><br />
                          Step 6: Once you press create time slot, it will allow you to input a start time, input the number of
                          researchers (users that can signup for the test), and specify which standing points you would like
                          the test to be conducted at. Due to the way the data is collected for the Acoustical Profile Test,
                          only one researcher is allowed per test. Once finished, press ‘Complete’ and the test will be
                          created.
                      </p>

                <h3><u> Completing the Test </u></h3>
                  <p> Step 1: Sign up for the test as you would any other test and press Begin <br /><br />
                      Step 2: The test will open with a map of the project location and a point in which the researcher
                      will stand to conduct the test. Once you click start, the timer will begin to count down and
                      prompt the user for input in intervals of 5 seconds, and when the timer reaches zero. <br /><br />
                      Step 3: Once the timer reaches a 5 second interval or is up it will prompt the user to enter the
                      sound decibel level that it says on their reader. After inputting the sound decibel level, it will
                      prompt the user to input ALL the types of sounds they heard during that time interval. After
                      inputting that, it will prompt the user to identify the MAIN type of sound heard they heard during
                      that time interval. <br /><br />
                      Step 4: Once those questions have been answered it will prompt the user to move to the next
                      standing point, in which the user will either move to the next standing point or remain in place if
                      there is only one standing point. <br /><br />
                      Step 5: Steps 3 and 4 will be repeated for however many times as set by the project admin. A
                      user’s progress for completing the tests is displayed in the top left as it will show which number
                      input they are on out of the total number of inputs. This test is quite lengthy and was designed
                      with the intention that once started it will be completed. Please make sure to account for this
                      when completing a test. <br /><br />
                      Step 6: Once the test is completed, the results will automatically be saved and can be viewed on
                      the home page along with all other projects and their results. It can also be viewed on the
                      website.
                  </p>

                <h3><u> Viewing the Results </u></h3>
                  <p> Step 1: Go to the home page of the mobile app. On the home page you will see a list titled
                      ‘Results’ that will contain each project you are a part of. <br /><br />
                      Step 2: Select the project you would like to view the results for. It will then take you to the main
                      results page where you can see a map of the project site, administrative information about that
                      project, a button to receive the results in a CSV file via email, and pages of lists that contain tests
                      that were completed for the project. <br /><br />
                      Step 3: To view a specific test, click on the test you would like to see. Once you select a specific
                      test, you will be taken to the results page for that specific test. At the top you will be able to see
                      all the administrative information for that test. Below that you will have the option to view the test
                      results on a map by clicking on the ‘View Map’ button. Below the view map button you will also

                      select the date in which you want the test to be completed. <br /><br />
                      Step 4: For the Spatial Boundaries Test, you will have to set the time that you would like the
                      researcher to spend at the test site. The default is 20 minutes. Once you have filled out all the
                      above information, press next. <br /><br />
                      Step 5: Once you press next, it will take you to the time slot page in which you will create a time
                      slot for the test to be completed. Press ‘Create Time Slot’. <br /><br />
                      Step 6: Once you press create time slot, it will allow you to input a start time and input the
                      number of researchers (users that can signup for the test). Once finished, press ‘Complete’ and
                      the test will be created.
                  </p>

                <h3><u> Completing the Test </u></h3>
                  <p> Step 1: Sign Up for the test as you would any other test and press begin <br /><br />
                      Step 2: Once you press begin, the test will open to the project site along with a glimpse of the
                      test. In order to start the test, press start in the top left corner and the timer will begin counting
                      down. <br /><br />
                      Step 3: You can now plot boundaries as needed. At the bottom there are three boundary types
                      to choose from. ‘Constructed’ which is for boundaries that take up space vertically such as
                      fences, buildings, monuments, etc. ‘Material’ boundaries are things that take up space
                      horizontally on the ground and consist of things like sidewalks, grass areas, boardwalks, etc.
                      ‘Shelter’ boundaries are things that take up space horizontally overhead such as canopy, tree
                      cover, awnings, etc. To plot a boundary, simply press on the type of boundary you would like
                      and begin plotting points, outlining that boundary. If you place a point but don’t like where it was
                      plotted you can press delete and it will only delete the last point you plotted and will allow you to
                      keep plotting. If you decide the boundary you are drawing isn’t necessary or correct you can
                      press cancel to return to boundary types. <br /><br />
                      Step 4: Once you are sure the boundary you have drawn is correct, press confirm. It will then
                      prompt you to answer questions about the boundary you just drew. <br /><br />
                      Step 5: After completing the prompts, it will allow you to plot more points as necessary in which
                      you will simply repeat steps 3 and 4. You are also able to view and filter through the boundaries
                      you have already drawn using the dropdown menu at the top. Simply press end in the top left
                      whenever you have completed the test. If the timer runs out, don’t worry, your input will still be
                      saved. <br /><br />
                      Step 6: Once the test is completed, the results will automatically be saved and can be viewed on
                      the home page along with all other projects and their results. It can also be viewed on the
                      website.
